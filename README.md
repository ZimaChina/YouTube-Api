# YouTube-Api

Ill take my time later to fill this space. 
So far, this is a project that I followed step by step from https://www.youtube.com/@patloeber
There are a couple of changes that I took  into my code, since the tutorial seems to have different ways to approach to some
of the functions. 
I recommend, if the channel Id doent work by taking it straight from the main page, to dig a little bit deeper into the source code of the page and 
find the alphanumeric id.
